:NextBlock                                                        *:NextBlock*
  This will go to the beginning of the line of the next block at the sibling
  level. If run on the last block inside another block, it will go to the
  first sibling of the parent block.

:BlockEnd                                                          *:BlockEnd*
  This will go to the end of the current block.

:ParentBlock                                                    *:ParentBlock*
  This will go to the beginning of the line of the immediate block surrounding
  the block you are currently in.

:PreviousBlock                                                *:PreviousBlock*
  This will go to the beginning of the line of the previous block at the
  sibling level. If run on the first block inside another block, it will go to
  the first previous sibling of the parent block.

:BlockHierarchy                                              *:BlockHierarchy*
  This will print the hierarchy of surrounding blocks of the current line.

:BlockEnv                                                          *:BlockEnv*
  *EXPERIEMENTAL* This should really only be used in RSpec style files, and it
  is tailored to those. It will print out the first line all `let/subject`
  blocks, as well as anytime an `@=` varable is defined in a setup section for
  a test.
