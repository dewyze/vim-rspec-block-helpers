# CONTRIBUTING

I am open to feature adds and pull requests and issues. Feel free to open them
and I will take a look!

It may be helpful to ask before opening a pull request if I would consider
merging the feature so you don't waste time on something that won't get merged.


### Improvements
- Updates for minitest or unit test
- Other maneuvers?
